Laparoscopic surgery, often called keyhole surgery, is a minimally invasive procedure that plays a big role in diagnosing and treating infertility in women. It’s a tool that helps doctors see what’s going on inside the abdomen—especially the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries—without making large cuts. It’s done under general anesthesia, and most women go home the same day or next.

So, how exactly does it help in fertility treatment?

1. Diagnosis of hidden issues:
Sometimes, even when blood tests and ultrasounds are normal, a woman is not able to conceive. In such cases, laparoscopy can uncover hidden problems like:

Endometriosis

Fibroids

Pelvic adhesions (scar tissue)

Blocked fallopian tubes
These issues are not always visible on regular scans, so laparoscopy is the best way to get a clear picture.

2. Treating endometriosis:
Mild or moderate endometriosis is one of the top causes of infertility. During laparoscopy, doctors can burn or cut out endometriosis spots, which improves the chances of natural pregnancy or success with IVF.

3. Removing fibroids or cysts:
Laparoscopy can remove fibroids, ovarian cysts, or polyps that may be stopping pregnancy. Since it's minimally invasive, recovery is faster and there's less damage to healthy tissues.

4. Unblocking fallopian tubes:
If one or both fallopian tubes are blocked, laparoscopy helps remove the blockage or separate the tubes from scar tissue. This can restore natural fertility in some women.

5. Treating ectopic pregnancy:
Sometimes, a pregnancy starts growing in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. This is dangerous and needs emergency laparoscopy. After healing, women can still go on to conceive, either naturally or through IVF.

6. Ovarian drilling for PCOS:
For women with PCOS who are not ovulating even after medicines, doctors may do a procedure called ovarian drilling through laparoscopy. It helps restart ovulation in many cases.

The best part is, recovery after laparoscopy is quick. You’ll usually have 2–3 small cuts on your tummy, and you can walk around in a day or two. Most women go back to normal life within a week.
